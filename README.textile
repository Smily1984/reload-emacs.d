h1. PreInstall
You must install braid to maintain the vender elisp lib.
Braid is a simple tool to help track git and svn vendor branches in a git repository.

h2. Requirements

* git 1.6+ (and git-svn if you want to mirror svn repositories)
* main >= 2.8.0
* open4 >= 0.9.6

h2. Installing using rubygems - official releases

  gem install braid

If further down the line, you want to bring new changes from rails in your repository, just update the mirror:

  braid update vendor/70rubyonrails/rinari

Or, if you want all mirrors updated:

  braid update
